I am going to create a blog that contains everything you need to know about fishing for an audience ranging from beginner to veteran fishermen. I would create one post pertaining to locating and catching crappie. I could make one big post or break it up into many as I would address lure presentation, color, time of year, etc. Fishing during the spawn, dead of winter, or in the dog days of summer- its all very different. I could then do the same for smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, kentuckies, rock bass, stripers, catfish, and trout since trying to single these fish out and catch them alone is all very different from eachother.

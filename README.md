# Writing
## Robert
When I write, I use an *outline* if my professor requires it; otherwise, I just start writing. I don't usually have a problem writing things in word. I don't like wasting too much time on pre-writing. I really just don't like academic writing in general.
>I like to write about **fish**. 
### I catch:
- Smallmouth
- Largemouth
- Crappie
- **SHARKS**

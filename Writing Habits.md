## Writing Habits
- I typically wait until the night before something is due and knock it all out at once.
- I suffer from a life-long case of writer's block.
- I don't organize before writing; I jump right in from the beginning.
## Improvement
- I like the idea of working on something everyday because 20 minutes a day for six days sounds a lot better than two straight hours. 
## Strength
- I can get a point across in a few words.

I was not happy about the assignment at first because I struggled with the codes and formatting. Once I buckled down and did it though, it wasn't so bad. I should have probably chosen a different topic though because the one that I did choose had a lot of small technical steps in it that I could not mention due to word restraints. I feel I should get a passing grade on this assignment because it was complex and I think it looked well-formatted.
